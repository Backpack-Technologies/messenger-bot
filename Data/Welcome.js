`We are trying to expand the market from our side and looking for partners who can reach the audience in their platform which we canâ€™t reach from our end. 
Our partnership initial model is based on a cashback system, the user will buy X amount and we will give them x% as cashback amount in backpack cash credit, which they can use for the future purchases.

For starting up, if you are a regular shopper at Backpack, you can write us an email, and then we can offer you a deal. For new shoppers, we are offering 5% cashback if they shop items greater than $1000 (minimum purchase amount) 
In fact, we are giving the cashback from our profits, for this reason, the amount will differ according to the products the shopper purchase from us.

We also have a tier system, where if you buy more, you will get more percentage from our side. For example, if the shopper spends 1000-1500$ we will offer minimum 5% cash back, for 1500-2000$ we will offer minimum 6%, and for greater than 2000$ it might reach up to minimum 7%.`,
